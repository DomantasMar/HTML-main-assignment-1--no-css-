            <p>League of Legends is a free-to-play competitive 5 versus 5 multiplayer online battle arena that has been released on October 27th, 2009, 
                also developed by Riot games. It took inspiration from <i>Defense of the Ancients</i> and <i>Warcraft III</i>. In the game a player controls 
            a character or "champion" with a set of unique abilities while teaming up with 4 other players. Over the course of the match, champions gain levels 
            and buy items to get stronger through the course of the game. The main objective is to attack your opponents team bases "<i>heart</i>" or as the game 
            calls it "<i>Nexus</i>" and to destroy it while also protecting your own.</p>
